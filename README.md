Jarvis - Voice-Activated Assistant

This is a Python-based voice-activated assistant named Jarvis, which can recognize voice commands and perform basic tasks such as opening websites, playing music, and responding to greetings.

Features

Wake Word Detection: Activates upon hearing the word "Jarvis".

Voice Commands: Supports the following commands:

"Open Google": Opens the Google homepage in the default web browser.

"Open YouTube": Opens YouTube in the default web browser.

"Play Music": Opens Spotify in the default web browser.

"Hello": Responds with a greeting.

"Goodbye": Exits the application.

Speech Feedback: Provides spoken feedback for recognized commands and actions.

Requirements

To run this application, you need to have the following Python libraries installed:

speech_recognition: For speech-to-text recognition.

pyttsx3: For text-to-speech conversion.

webbrowser: For opening websites in the default browser.

You can install the required libraries using pip:

pip install SpeechRecognition pyttsx3

How It Works

Initialization: Jarvis initializes with a greeting and begins listening for the wake word "Jarvis".

Wake Word Detection: Once "Jarvis" is detected, it activates and listens for a command.

Command Processing: Based on the recognized command, it performs the corresponding action or provides feedback if the command is not understood.

Continuous Listening: Jarvis continues running until the command "Goodbye" is given.

How to Run

Ensure you have a microphone connected to your system.

Save the script to a file (e.g., jarvis.py).

Run the script using Python:

python jarvis.py

Speak the wake word "Jarvis" followed by one of the supported commands.

Example Usage

Start the program:

python jarvis.py

Say:

"Jarvis, open Google."

"Jarvis, play music."

"Jarvis, hello."

"Jarvis, goodbye."

Troubleshooting

If the application doesn't recognize your voice:

Ensure your microphone is working properly.

Speak clearly and loudly enough.

If you encounter any issues with the Google Speech Recognition service:

Check your internet connection.

Ensure the speech_recognition library is correctly installed.

Future Improvements

Add support for more commands.

Enable integration with additional services or APIs.

Improve natural language processing for more flexible command recognition.
